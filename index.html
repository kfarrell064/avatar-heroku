<p>Good (morning/afternoon). Testing will begin after you complete the
identification information on your answer sheet. The College Board is obligated
to report scores that accurately reflect your performance. Therefore, exam
administration and security procedures are in place to ensure that all of you
have an equal opportunity to demonstrate your abilities and that no one has an
unfair advantage. Please listen carefully to the following instructions.
If your bags have not been collected, close all bags now and place them on the
floor under your chair; you are not permitted to access your bags or any
unauthorized aids at any time, including during the break, until you are dismissed
at the end of the exam. The following electronic equipment is prohibited:
phones, smartwatches or wearable technology of any kind, laptops, tablet
computers, Bluetooth devices, portable listening or recording devices—MP3
player, iPod®
, etc.—cameras or other photographic equipment, devices that can
access the internet, separate timers of any type, and any other electronic or
communication devices. If you are observed with any of these devices at any
time during testing or during breaks, the device will be confiscated, you will be
dismissed, and your score may be canceled. If the College Board determines
that you tried to gain an unfair advantage, you may be banned from future
College Board assessments.
If you have any of these devices, bring them to me now. Make sure each device
is turned off. You may pick them up when you are dismissed. Are there any
questions?</p>
